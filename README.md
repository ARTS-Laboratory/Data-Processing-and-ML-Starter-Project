# Data Processing and ML Starter Project

This repo acts as a crash course for learning data processing and machine learning, and how to apply them in engineering research. The repo consists of a few self-study Jupyter notebooks which will get the novice researcher up-to-speed, then a final project which combines everything they've learned. Each notebook walks through problems related to its subject matter and then provides a few challenge problems. Solution codes to the challenge problems are provided in the `/solutions` branch -- but we recommend trying to solve them yourself first!

Good luck!

## Software

We recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) to manage your python environment and IDE (integrated development environment) of choice.
The easiest way to use GitHub repos is with [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).

The notebooks require the following packages:\
numpy\
scipy\
sklearn\
tensorflow <= 2.13
## Jupyter Notebook Lessons

The notebook lessons cover the essentials of data processing. While working through the lesson, the learner is encouraged to run the notebook and examine what is happening line by line. In my experience, the best way to understand code is to experiment with it: break it, fix it, etc. while trying to figure out how it works. Each lesson contains one or more challenge problems which should be entirely feasible if the learner understands the content of the notebook. They are good a good opportunity to test your comprehension and work on 'connecting the dots' in the same way you'll need to when performing research - but if you are stuck, the `/solutions` branch has solution code for all the challenge problems.
