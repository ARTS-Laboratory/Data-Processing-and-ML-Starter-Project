Python is a great language for scientific programming because it's easy to quickly throw together workable code. It also has a huge number of libraries to do basically anything in the realm of scientific computing or data processing. In this first notebook, we'll go over the basics of Python and also gain some familiarity with the library we'll be using the most in in these notebooks -- NumPy.\n",
